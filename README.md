# Case Interaction Evaluation Tool

This prototype is a simulation platform for pharmacy education built on AWS. Students interact with AI-powered patient personas through text and voice chat, practicing clinical assessment and communication skills in a safe, repeatable environment. Instructors create simulation groups with configurable patient scenarios, and the system generates AI-powered debriefs evaluating student performance against key clinical questions.
