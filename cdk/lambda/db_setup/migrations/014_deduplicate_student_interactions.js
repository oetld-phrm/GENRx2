/**
 * Migration 014: Deduplicate student_interactions
 *
 * Removes duplicate student_interactions rows where the same
 * (persona_id, enrollment_id) pair has multiple entries. This was
 * caused by enrollment flows creating student_interaction rows
 * without checking for existing records.
 *
 * Keeps the row that has chats (actual student activity) attached.
 * If multiple rows have chats, keeps the one with the most chats.
 * If none have chats, keeps the most recently accessed one.
 * Deletes the rest.
 *
 * Also adds a unique index to prevent future duplicates.
 *
 * Idempotent: only deletes rows that are true duplicates.
